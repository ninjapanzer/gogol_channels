## GoGol Channels

So back in https://github.com/ninjapanzer/gogol I had some fun building a renderer and some groundwork for creating a kafka gol but I figured it might be nice to try it with channels to learn go channels as a method of pipe based communication

### Usage
To run use `make`

To build use `make build`
